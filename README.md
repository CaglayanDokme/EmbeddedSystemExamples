# EmbeddedSystemExamples
This is the repo where I share the example designs I've created. 
The example designs has only the purpose of exercising. 
I will try to explain each individual design in a blog post. 
The full list of example designs are as below. 
* [Shared BRAM](https://medium.com/@caglayandokme/a-shared-bram-example-with-microblaze-and-zynq-soc-949495b5f540): A system containing the Zynq PS and Microblaze together. CPUs communicate over a shared BRAM. 
* [Microblaze DDR](https://medium.com/@caglayandokme/extending-the-memory-limits-of-microblaze-with-an-external-ddr-6c896e75c218): A system containing a Microblaze core and a MIG 7 series component to interact with external DDR memory. 

The repo also has some utility files. They can be used to enhance/optimize the process of setting up a development environment. 
* **Project Creator**: A file for invoking the Vivado and initially running a tickle file in it. There are two versions of this file, one for [Windows](https://github.com/CaglayanDokme/EmbeddedSystemExamples/blob/main/ProjectCreator.bat)*(.bat)* and the other for [Linux](https://github.com/CaglayanDokme/EmbeddedSystemExamples/blob/main/ProjectCreator.sh)*(.sh)*. 
* [**Initial Tickle**](https://github.com/CaglayanDokme/EmbeddedSystemExamples/blob/main/InitialTickleExample.tcl): An example Tickle file that can be used in Vivado for the automatization of project creation process. User can modify this file to produce an initial tickle file for his/her own projects. I generally use it to save some space in repositories. It also helps management of projects by dramatically decreasing the number of versioned files.
* **Directory Cleaner**: This is a basic utility to clear all files generated by Vivado when project creation occurs. You can run it right before committing your changes to your repo. Use it with tickle automatization scripts for better experience. There are two versions of this file, one for [Windows](https://github.com/CaglayanDokme/EmbeddedSystemExamples/blob/main/ClearDirectory.bat)*(.bat)* and the other for [Linux](https://github.com/CaglayanDokme/EmbeddedSystemExamples/blob/main/ClearDirectory.sh)*(.sh)*.
