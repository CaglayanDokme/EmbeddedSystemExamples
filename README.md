# EmbeddedSystemExamples
This is the repo where I share the example designs I've created. 
The example designs has only the purpose of exercising. 
I will try to explain each individual design in a blog post. 
The full list of example designs are as below. 
* [Shared BRAM](https://medium.com/@caglayandokme/a-shared-bram-example-with-microblaze-and-zynq-soc-949495b5f540): A system containing the Zynq PS and Microblaze together. CPUs communicate over a shared BRAM. 
* [Microblaze DDR](https://medium.com/@caglayandokme/extending-the-memory-limits-of-microblaze-with-an-external-ddr-6c896e75c218): A system containing a Microblaze core and a MIG 7 series component to interact with external DDR memory. 
* [**XADC Example**](https://github.com/CaglayanDokme/EmbeddedSystemExamples/tree/main/ZedboardXadc): This is an example project for monitoring the ADC sensors placed on the Zedboard. Both the internal and external ADC sensor inputs are monitored in the example. It doesn't have a blogpost as the example is so simple. 
* [**Zynq PS GPIO**](https://github.com/CaglayanDokme/EmbeddedSystemExamples/tree/main/ZynqPsGpio): This is an example project for utilizing the GPIO component of Zynq PS. It includes the example usage of the pins both in input and output modes. In addition, IRQ handling is also covered. The project is based on Zedboard.
* [**Zynq Private Timer**](https://github.com/CaglayanDokme/EmbeddedSystemExamples/tree/main/ZynqPrivateTimer): An example project showing the example usage of Zynq SCU Timer with interrupt generation. The project is based on Zedboard.
* [**Zynq Watchdog Timer**](https://github.com/CaglayanDokme/EmbeddedSystemExamples/tree/main/ZynqWatchdogTimer): An example project showing the example usage of Watchdog timer in Zynq. The application is responsible for resetting the Watchdog timer so that it doesn't expire. If the user fails to press the button in the given time, then the Watchdog timer expires and system reset occurs.

The repo also has some utility files. They can be used to enhance/optimize the process of setting up a development environment. 
* **Project Creator**: A file for invoking the Vivado and initially running a tickle file in it. There are two versions of this file, one for [Windows](https://github.com/CaglayanDokme/EmbeddedSystemExamples/blob/main/ProjectCreator.bat)*(.bat)* and the other for [Linux](https://github.com/CaglayanDokme/EmbeddedSystemExamples/blob/main/ProjectCreator.sh)*(.sh)*. 
* [**Initial Tickle**](https://github.com/CaglayanDokme/EmbeddedSystemExamples/blob/main/InitialTickleExample.tcl): An example Tickle file that can be used in Vivado for the automatization of project creation process. User can modify this file to produce an initial tickle file for his/her own projects. I generally use it to save some space in repositories. It also helps management of projects by dramatically decreasing the number of versioned files.
* **Directory Cleaner**: This is a basic utility to clear all files generated by Vivado when project creation occurs. You can run it right before committing your changes to your repo. Use it with tickle automatization scripts for better experience. There are two versions of this file, one for [Windows](https://github.com/CaglayanDokme/EmbeddedSystemExamples/blob/main/ClearDirectory.bat)*(.bat)* and the other for [Linux](https://github.com/CaglayanDokme/EmbeddedSystemExamples/blob/main/ClearDirectory.sh)*(.sh)*.
